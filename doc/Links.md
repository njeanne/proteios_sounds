P53 read by supercollider. Each amino acid is mapped to a specific sound sample.
Different instruments were recorded or taken from sample libraries : guitar, piano, cello, percussions, ...
Chords or single notes were used whether the amino acids were aromatic or not.
Correlations between pitch, length of the note(s), timbers and the amino acids physico chemical characteristics were used for the mapping.
Evolution of the tempi follows the functional domains of the protein and a randomization on the duration of the notes was performed via supercollider.
